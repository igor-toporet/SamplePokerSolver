In order to run unit-tests execute in console 'build.cmd' and  batch files from root solution folder.

File 'build.cmd' runs rebuilds solution in Release mode

File 'run-unit-tests.cmd' runs xunit console tests runner with specified assembly containing tests and indication to create html output file.

Thus file 'test-run.html' will be created in the root solution folder. Later this file is opened in default web-browser.

You might consider open xunit GUI runner (from path \Lib\xunit-1.7\xunit.gui.clr4.exe) and under Assembly menu add assembly Src\UnitTests\bin\Release\PokerHandShowdownSolver.UnitTests.dll
